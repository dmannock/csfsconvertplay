# DEPRECATED Work will continue at: https://github.com/willsam100/FShaper

- A quick play at creating a C# to F# converter
- Couldn't find anything online (except links below)
- Finally stumbled accross a project, much more complete. Searches don't seem to find it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- Work will continue there:
https://github.com/willsam100/FShaper

Please feel free to help :)

### Other options found in previous searches for c# to f#:
- C# transpiling (non-.net) but no f# output https://github.com/reignstudios/CS2X
- C# to js https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge
- F# ast to code (alone with formatting etc) https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas (used this)
- C# 2 F# (would have been ideal, however: not updated, no core support, etc) https://github.com/7shi/cs2fs
